		<h3>Discord</h3>
		<p>Discord is a proprietary, freeware IM/VoIP platform. Invitation link to basdon's official discord "server": <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/w4jFpqd" rel="nofollow">https://discordapp.com/invite/w4jFpqd</a>{@globe}. If you need to contact the owner directly, send a message to robin_be#2125.</p>
		<h3>IRC</h3>
		<p>Internet Relay Chat is a protocol for textual communications. Basdon has its main channel #basdon and echo channel #basdon.echo on LUNet (<a href=http://liberty-unleashed.co.uk/irc/servers/>irc.liberty-unleashed.co.uk</a>{@globe}). Chatlogs can be found at <a href="{@unsafe $ABS_URL}/s/chatlogs">{@unsafe $ABS_URL}/s/chatlogs</a>. New to IRC? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients">List of IRC clients</a>{@globe}. Administrator users can be recognized by symbols @ or &amp; in front of their name (modes +o and +a). Owners have a ~ symbol in front of their name (mode +q). IRC has no offline messaging.</p>
		<h3>E-mail</h3>
		<p>If none of the above works for you, nobody is available, you want to make sure your message ends up with the owner, or you simply want to make sure that someone reads your message (eventually), you can also send an e-mail to: robin@basdon.net.</p>
