<p>
	Flying and driving consumes fuel. Each vehicle has its own fuel capacity and
	fuel usage, which can be seen on the <?php link_article('List_of_aircraft'); ?>
	page.
<p>
	The indicated fuel usage is applicable when throttle is applied. On engine
	idle, the actual fuel usage is <?=$SETTING__FUEL_USAGE_IDLE_MODIFIER*100?>% of the
	indicated fuel usage. No fuel is being used when the engine is shut down.
	See <?php link_article('Keys'); ?> on how to shut down the engine.
