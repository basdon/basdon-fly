This is the specification of the {@code .flight} file format used to store
mission flight data.

<pre>
byte 0: version
byte 1-3: 'F', 'L', 'Y'
</pre>

The rest is dependent on the spec version:

{@ul
  {@li {@#=v6 Version 6}}
  {@li {@#=old Old versions}
    {@ul
      {@li {@#=v5 Version 5}}
      {@li {@#=v4 Version 4}}
      {@li {@#=v3 Version 3}}
      {@li {@#=v2 Version 2}}
      {@li {@#=v1 Version 1}}
    }
  }
}

{@h3(id="v6") Version 6}

{@ul
  {@li player name (length) has been removed from the header}
  {@li vehicle model has been removed from the header}
  {@li vehicle fuel capacity has been removed from the header, fuel level data
       in frames is now a percentage (as a value [0-1])}
  {@li a {@code flags} field has been added to the header, so all flight files
       can have the same version and structure and this field determines which
       data is available as opposed to using the version field}
}

	bit 1: mission start packet received, if this is unset it
	       means that these flags were never set correctly

if there was an issue with a mission start packet:
{@ul
  {@li vehicle fuel capacity may be {@code 0}}

{@h4(id="v4") Version 4}

The format of version 4 is identical to {@#=v5 Version 5}, but version 4 had
a bug where the {@code altitude} value had bogus data (it was the same as
{@code pitch10}). To distinguish between flight files generated with bogus
altitude data and corrently generated flight files, the version was bumped.
