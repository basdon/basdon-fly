<p>
	Verdant Meadows, also known as Verdant Meadows Aircraft Graveyard, is an
	abandoned airfield located in the desert of Bone County. It is very close to
	<?php link_article('Area_69'); ?>. There are many old, crashed planes and
	parts laying around close to the runway. There is a small ATC building near
	the eastern end of the runway.
<p>
	Despite having a long and wide runway (the widest of all mainland airports!),
	landing a big plane can be difficult as there are hangars at both sides,
	potentially forming obstructions for an aircraft's wings.

<h3>Service points</h3>

<p>
	Being abandoned, there are no service points to be found. The runway also
	doesn't have any navigational aids, however, there is a working beacon present.
