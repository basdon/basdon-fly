<h3>Mission selection</h3>

<p>
	Previously, you would receive a random mission when entering <code>/w</code>. This
	update brings the new mission map. The mission map can be shown when you are
	positioned in a mission point with a suitable vehicle. Then, one of the
	destinations can be selected (or a completely random destination) to start a
	mission.

<p>
	Typing <code>/w</code> when not in a mission point will allow you to set a
	checkpoint to the nearest mission point.

<h3>Updated panel design</h3>

<p>
	The aviation panel has been slightly updated. It now also shows the gear
	state (green = down, red = up, yellow = transitioning). ODO and HP/FL bars
	are moved inside the panel. The VOR bar always shows now, but the indicator
	will only show when VOR is active.

<p>
	The panel also has night colors that will be active between 21h and 6h. This
	can be disabled in <code>/p</code>.
