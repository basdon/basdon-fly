Los Santos Airport was originally built as the airport for the National Guard of
Los Santos. It was transformed into a civil airport in 1942. Since then, the
terminals have seen millions of passengers passing through.

The airport is located at the southern beach of Los Santos, bordered by the
freeway, Verdant Bluffs, El Corona and Willowfied.

There are two long runways at LSA, which are connected to each other in a
U-shape. All runways have full navigation capabilities. There is only a single
helipad at LSA.
