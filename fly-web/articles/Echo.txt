The echo service is the bridge between in-game chat and IRC chat. The IRC side
of echo is implemented as an {@a=https://github.com/yugecin/anna Anna^} mod.

Echo runs on ports {@code 7767} (IRC) and {@code 7768} (In-game).

{@h3 Packet spec}

<pre>
byte 0: F
byte 1: L
byte 2: Y
byte 3: packet id
</pre>

{@h4(id=p2) Packet 2: Hello}

A {@code Hello} packet is sent to the other side when the echo service comes
online. Upon receiving, the other side should send an {@#=p3 I'm there}
packet back.

<pre>
byte 4-7: random value (values 0 and 1 are forbidden)
</pre>

{@b Note}: IRC should also send a {@#=p8 Status} packet when sending this
packet. Game doesn't need to do this since nobody will be online when the game
echo bridge starts.

{@h4(id=p3) Packet 3: I'm there}

An {@code I'm there} packet is sent as a response to a {@#=p2 Hello packet}.

<pre>
byte 4-7: same as bytes 4-7 as received from the Hello packet
</pre>

{@b Note}: A {@#=p8 Status} packet should also be sent when sending this packet.

{@h4(id=p4) Packet 4: Bye}

Sent when an echo service is shutting down (either side).

{@h4(id=p5) Packet 5: Ping}

Simple ping packet. Upon receiving, the other side should send an
{@#=p6 Pong} packet back with the same random value.

<pre>
byte 4-7: random value (values 0 and 1 are forbidden)
</pre>

Currently, pings are only sent from IRC to game at a specified interval. IRC
knows if game is down if they don't receive pongs, and game will know when IRC
is down when it hasn't received a ping packet in the designated interval.

{@h4(id=p6) Packet 6: Pong}

Response to a {@#=p5 Ping} packet.

<pre>
byte 4-7: same as bytes 4-7 as received from the Ping packet
</pre>

{@h4(id=p7) Packet 7: Status request}

Request a {@#=p8 Status} packet. Usually this request is made when a user
connects. The payload of the response is then sent to the user, so they can be
informed about the Echo connection.

{@h4(id=p8) Packet 8: Status}

Sent to respond to a {@#=p7 Status request} packet, or accompanying either a
{@#=p2 Hello} or {@#=p3 I'm there} packet.

<pre>
byte 4: 1 if this is sent as a response to a status request packet
byte 5: lo byte of length of the status message
byte 6: hi byte of length of the status message
byte 7 - 7+[byte5/6]: status message

total len: 7+[byte5/6]
</pre>

The status message usually contains the connected IRC channel/network (if
sent from IRC to game), the amount of users, and the names of some of the
users.

{@h4(id=p10) Packet 10: Chat}

A simple packet saying someone sent a message. This packet can be sent from
either side.

<pre>
byte 4: lo byte of player id as WORD (0 when IRC to game)
byte 5: hi byte of player id as WORD (0 when IRC to game)
byte 6: length of the nickname (must be less than 50)
byte 7: lo byte of length of the message as WORD (must be less than 512)
byte 8: hi byte of length of the message as WORD (must be less than 512)
byte 9 - 8+[byte6]: nickname
byte 9+[byte6] - 8+[byte6]+[byte7/8]: message

total len: 9+[byte6]+[byte7/8]
</pre>

{@h4(id=p11) Packet 11: Action}

Basically a copy of the {@#=p10 Chat} packet, but for an action ({@code /me}
command).

{@h4(id=p12) Packet 12: Generic message}

Packet with a type and a message. See types below.

<pre>
byte 4: message type
byte 5: lo byte of length of the message (max 450)
byte 6: hi byte of length of the message (max 450)
byte 7 - 6+[byte5/6]: message

total len: 7+[byte5/6]
</pre>

Types:

<pre>
0: flight message, sent from game to irc when a player finishes a flight
1: trac, sent from web to game and irc when a trac ticket/comment was made

byte 5: hi byte of player id as WORD (0 when IRC to game)
