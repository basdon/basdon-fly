Flying and driving consumes fuel. Each vehicle has its own fuel capacity and
fuel usage, which can be seen on the {@article List_of_aircraft} page.  The
indicated fuel usage is applicable when throttle is applied. On engine idle,
the actual fuel usage is <?=$SETTING__FUEL_USAGE_IDLE_MODIFIER*100?>% of the
indicated fuel usage. No fuel is being used when the engine is shut down.
See {@article Keys} on how to shut down the engine.
