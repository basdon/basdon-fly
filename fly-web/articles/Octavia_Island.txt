Octavia Island is an island to the north east of Las Venturas. The airport at
the island has two long runways, bordered by a long beach. The residential areas
consist of a few housing blocks. There is a big mountain at the north-west of
the island.

The airport has a few parking spots for big airplanes, such as Andromadas or
AT-400s.

This island was made and named as a memorial for Octavia_Scratch, a former
player of The Pilot's Life server (another aviation server for SA:MP), who sadly
passed away. An NPC with her usual skin can be found at the lighthouse, which
she used to own in the aforementioned server.

{@h3 Service points}

There are two service points at Octavia Island, however, only one is at the
airport. The other service point is a gas station, which can not be used for
aircrafts. Some pilots have parked their helicopter on top of the gas station
and tried to refuel, but the local residents were not amused.
