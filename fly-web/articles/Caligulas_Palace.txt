Caligula's Palace Airport is a small runway on top of one of the buildings of
the Caligula's Palace Casino, now connecting high-profile businessmen and women
with their gambling addiction faster than ever.

{@article=List_of_aircraft#Dodo Dodo} aircrafts can land here without much
difficulties, but the San Andreas Aviation Authority has disallowed
{@article=List_of_aircraft#Shamal Shamal} aircrafts to operate at CALI. While
it is possible to land and take-off, they believe the limited space makes it
too risky to taxi using this aircraft type.

Some months after the initial opening of the airport, a heli pad marking was
added and the SAAA approved helicopter traffic. Now businessmen and
businesswoman with a too big ego to sit in a Dodo can come through here with
their helicopters.

{@h3 Service points}

Since CALI is just a runway on top of a building, there are no service points
available. The closest one is probably to be found at
{@article Las_Venturas_Airport}.
