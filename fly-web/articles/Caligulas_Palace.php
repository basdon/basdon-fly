<p>
	Caligula's Palace Airport is a small runway on top of one of the buildings of
	the Caligula's Palace Casino, now connecting high-profile businessmen and women
	with their gambling addiction faster than ever.
<p>
	<?php link_article('List_of_aircraft', '#Dodo', true) ?>Dodo</a> aircrafts
	can land here without much difficulties, but the San Andreas Aviation Authority
	has disallowed
	<?php link_article('List_of_aircraft', '#Shamal', true) ?>Shamal</a> aircrafts
	to operate at CALI. While it is possible to land and take-off, they believe the
	limited space makes it too risky to taxi using this aircraft type.
<p>
	Some months after the initial opening of the airport, a heli pad marking was
	added and the SAAA approved helicopter traffic. Now businessmen and
	businesswoman with a too big ego to sit in a Dodo can come through here with
	their helicopters.

	Since CALI is just a runway on top of a building, there are no service points
	available. The closest one is probably to be found at
