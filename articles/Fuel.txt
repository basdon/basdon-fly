Flying and driving consumes fuel. Each vehicle has its own fuel capacity and
fuel usage, which can be seen on the {@article List_of_aircraft} page.  The
indicated fuel usage is applicable when throttle is applied. On idle usage,
the actual fuel usage is 1/5th of the indicated fuel usage. No fuel is being
used when the engine is shut down. See {@article Keys} on how to shut down the
engine.
