Service points are areas where you can repair and refuel your vehicle. They are
marked on the radar with a S symbol: <img
src="<?=$STATICPATH?>/articles/servicepoint.png" alt="Sweet mission icon"
title="Service point marker"/>. Beware: because of SA-MP limits, a service point
map icon does not show unless you are close to it. If you are close enough,
there will also be a floating text label.

To repair your vehicle, use the command {@code /repair} or {@code /fix}.

To refuel your vehicle, use the command {@code /refuel}. You can only refuel
when the engine is turned off (see {@article Keys} on how to turn your
engine off).

Aside from the driver, passengers can also repair and refuel vehicles. In
that case, the passenger will pay the fee. The driver will receive a message
when this happens.

{@h3 Repair cost}

The repair cost is {@code $150 + $2 * (missing health)}. Every vehicle has a
maximum health of 1000 (they start burning at 250). So if your vehicle has 900
health, repairing will cost $350. This means you'll pay at least $152 and at
most $2150 (if you manage to get enough damage and then fix your vehicle before
it explodes).

If you don't have enough money, the vehicle will be partially repaired. The base
$150 cost covers the visual damage (including damage to aircraft controls) and
servicing fees, every $2 after that will fix one health point.

{@h3 Refuel cost}

The refuel cost is {@code $75 + $10 * (missing fuel percentage)}. This means
you'll pay at least $85 and at most $1075.

If you don't have enough money, the vehicle will be refueled as much as your
budget allows. The base $75 is paid for handling fees, every $10 after that
will add one percentage of fuel.

Note that not all aircraft have the same fuel capacity and usage, but the refuel
price is determined by percentages to not financially ruin players if they
choose to fly bigger aircraft.
