Passenger satisfaction is how satisified the passengers are when on a mission
that involves passengers. It is influenced by the pitch and roll of the
aircraft. When banking too much to either side, the satisfaction will decrease.
When the pitch is very high or very low, the satisfaction will decrease.

Having a passenger satisfaction less than 100% will negatively affect the pay
of the mission. $30 is subtracted for every percent under 100, making the
maximum penalty $3000.
