The Instrument Landing System, or ILS, helps with landing by guiding an aircraft
onto a runway. Unlike {@article VOR}, ILS offers both in horizontal and vertical
guidance.

{@h3 Usage}

<pre>
/ils
</pre>

ILS will only work when {@article VOR} is already engaged.

{@h3 HUD}

When in ILS range, several X symbols will be shown in a + formation. On both the
horizontal and vertical axis, one X will be red, indicating the position of the
optimal guideslope.

If the red X on the horizontal axis is to the right, the aircraft is too far
left. If the red X on the vertical axis is below the center, the aircraft is too
high. When the value is out of range, a number will be shown to give an idea of
how much out of position the aircraft is.

The goal is to keep both red Xs in the center, because that means the aircraft
is right on the optimal glideslope.

    Xs next to each other and 9 Xs above each other, both series having the \
    middle X in common.;ILS indicator}

In the image above, the optimal glideslope slightly below and to the right, so
the plane is a bit too high and slightly off the centerline.

When the aircraft is out of the ILS range, a 'No signal' text will show.

{@h3 Examples}

When the aircraft is nicely in the middle, both horizontally and vertically, the
ILS indicator will show the middle X in red.

}

When the aircraft is slightly to the left of the centerline, the red X on the
horizontal line is slightly towards the right because that's where the ideal
position is.

}

When the aircraft is far to the right, there will be no red X on the horizontal
axis for the horizontal deviation, but a number giving a slight indication how
far off the positioning is. Note that there IS still a red X on the horizontal
axis, but this is the indicator for the vertical axis, showing that the aircraft
is nicely in the middle of the vertical glidescope.

}

When the aircraft is completely out of range of the ILS signal, the indicator
will show 'No ILS signal'.
