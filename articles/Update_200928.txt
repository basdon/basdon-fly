The flight map on the website has received a deserved update. There are many
new additions and improvements.

{@ul
  {@li It's now zoomed in on the flight path}
  {@li The flight path will never go outside the view again}
  {@li Islands are drawn on the map}
  {@li Runways are drawn on the map}
  {@li Graphs received axes and are more clean}
  {@li Graphs can be hovered, showing the value at the hovered point}
  {@li On hovering, a plane icon shows on the route at the associated position}
  {@li An attitude indicator has been added, showing the pitch and roll}
}

{@b Please note that the attitude indicator will only work for flights
after August 9th 2020. The flights before that date did not save pitch/roll
data yet.}

Please note that flights between August 9th 2020 and August 12th 2020 do not
have altitude data due to a bug.
