Las Venturas Airport is an airport in the middle of Las Venturas, only a few
minutes away from The Strip. The airport is surrounded by the Blackfield Stadium
to the west, Redsands West to the north, the Harry Gold Parkway highway and The
Strip to the east and the LVA Freight Depot to the south.

If you're flying through LVA, try to get a night
flight. All the glitter and neon of Las Venturas makes lading or taking off
there an amazing experience.
