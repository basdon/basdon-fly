Easter Bay International Airport, better known as San Fierro Airport, is the
airport connecting San Fierro to the rest of San Andreas. It is the biggest of
the three main San Andreas airports, with a long runway that extends into the
waters of Easter Bay.

Many of the skyscrapers and of course the Garver Bridge and Kincaid Bridge can
be seen during takeoff and landing. Underneath the tarmac, there is a huge
underground parking place.
