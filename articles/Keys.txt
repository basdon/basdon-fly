There are a few hotkeys you can use while playing. The list below give the
names as seen in the settings menu.

Tip: the {@code /helpkeys} command shows you the bound keys in your game.

{@ul
  {@li {@b Start/Stop engine}: CONVERSATION - NO (foot controls)}
  {@li {@b Toggle landing gear}: SUB-MISSION (vehicle controls)}
}
