The Automatic Direction Finder, or ADF, helps finding the direction towards a
specific beacon. It tells the direction between the beacon and the aircraft,
the difference in altitude and the difference in current aircraft course and
course towards the beacon. For a list of beacons, see
{@article List_Of_Beacons}.

{@h3 Usage}

<pre>
/adf &lt;beacon&gt;

examples:

/adf salv
/adf SALS
</pre>

Beacons and specifiers can be in uppercase or lowercase or even mixed.

{@code &lt;beacon&gt;} is the code of the NDB beacon to use. See
{@article List_Of_Beacons} for a list of all the available beacons. When ingame,
the {@b /nearest} and {@b /beacons} commands can be used.

To disable the navigation, simply type {@code /adf} again.

{@h3 Panel}

When ADF is engaged, values will be shown in the navigation top part of the
panel.

Indicators and their meanings:

{@dl
  {@dt DIS}
  {@dd
    Horizontal distance between the aircraft and the beacon.
  }
  {@dt ALT}
  {@dd
    Difference in altitude. A positive number indicates the aircraft is at a
    higher altitude than the beacon, a negative number indicated the opposite.
  }
  {@dt CRS}
  {@dd
    Difference in the aircraft's course and the course towards the beacon. If
    this is 0, it means the aircraft is going directly towards the beacon.
  }
}

{@h4 CRS examples}

In the first image, the aircraft has a heading of 03 or 30&deg;. The course
towards the beacon is 09, or 90&deg. In this case, the {@code CRS} indicator
will show a value of {@code 60}.

In the second image, the aircraft still has a heading of 03, or 30&deg;. This
time the course towards the beacon is 33, or 330&deg;. Here, the {@code CRS}
indicator will show {@code -60}.
