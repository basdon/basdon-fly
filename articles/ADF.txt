The Automatic Direction Finder, or ADF, helps finding the direction towards a
specific beacon. It tells the direction between the beacon and the aircraft,
the difference in altitude and the difference in current aircraft course and
course towards the beacon.

{@h3 Usage}

<pre>
/adf &lt;beacon&gt;
</pre>

{@code &lt;beacon&gt;} is the code of the NDB beacon to use. See
{@article List_Of_Beacons} for a list of all the available beacons.

To disable the navigation, simply type {@code /adf} again.

{@h3 Panel}

When ADF is engaged, values will be shown in the navigation top part of the
panel.

{@infobox
  {@aimg=adf.png;a wide box with lots of numbers indicating speed, \
    altitude, heading, vertical air speed, navigation stuff;panel}
  {@small The aircraft panel with ADF navigation engaged}
}

The number next to {@code DIS} shows the distance between the aircraft and the
beacon. {@code ALT} displays the difference in altitude. A positive number means
the aircraft is at a higher altitude than the beacon, a negative number means
the aircraft is at a lower altitude than the beacon. {@code CRS} shows the
difference in the aircraft's course and the course towards the beacon. A
{@code CRS} value of 0 means the aircraft is going directly towards the beacon.
