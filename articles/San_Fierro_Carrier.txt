San Fierro Carrier is the 'airport' name of the naval amphibious assault ship
docked in the Easter Basin Naval Station of San Fierro. The ship is not actually
an aircraft carrier, but the locals name it as such since it can accommodate a
small number of {@article=List_of_aircraft#Hydra Hydra}s and
{@article=List_of_aircraft#Cargobob Cargobob}s.

Aside from the flight deck at the surface, there are two more decks inside.
Each of those decks provide storage area and house military hardware. The lower
deck provides access to open waters through the back gate of the carrier. There
is some space to dock a few small boats.

Two aircraft lifts are present, one at the back and one at the side near the
back. They connect the flight deck and the middle deck, so that aircrafts can
be stored in the middle deck.

There are also two inactive SAM sites.

{@h3 Service points}

The ship has no service points. Aircrafts in need for repair usually go to
{@article Area_69}, but there are also some service points at
{@article San_Fierro_Airport} for very urgent situations.
