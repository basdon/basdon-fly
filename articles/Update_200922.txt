{@h3 Mission selection}

Previously, you would receive a random mission when entering {@code /w}. This
update brings the new mission map. The mission map can be shown when you are
positioned in a mission point with a suitable vehicle. Then, one of the
destinations can be selected (or a completely random destination) to start a
mission.

Typing {@code /w} when not in a mission point will allow you to set a
checkpoint to the nearest mission point.

{@h3 Updated panel design}

The aviation panel has been slightly updated. It now also shows the gear
state (green = down, red = up, yellow = transitioning). ODO and HP/FL bars
are moved inside the panel. The VOR bar always shows now, but the indicator
will only show when VOR is active.

The panel also has night colors that will be active between 21h and 6h. This
can be disabled in {@code /p}.
