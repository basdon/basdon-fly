Verdant Meadows, also known as Verdant Meadows Aircraft Graveyard, is an
abandoned airfield located in the desert of Bone County. It is very close to
{@article=Area_69 Area 69}. There are many old, crashed planes and parts laying
around close to the runway. There is a small ATC building near the eastern end
of the runway.

Despite having a long and wide runway (the widest of all mainland airports!),
landing a big plane can be difficult as there are hangars at both sides,
potentially forming obstructions for an aircraft's wings.

Being abandoned, there are no service points to be found. The runway also
doesn't have any navigational aids, however, there is a working beacon present.
