Verdant Meadows, also known as Verdant Meadows Aircraft Graveyard, is an
abandoned airfield located in the desert of Bone County. It is very close to
{@article Area_69}. There are many old, crashed planes and parts laying
around close to the runway. There is a small ATC building near the eastern end
of the runway.

Despite having a long and wide runway (the widest of all mainland airports!),
landing a big plane can be difficult as there are hangars at both sides,
potentially forming obstructions for an aircraft's wings.

{@h3 Service points}

Being abandoned, there are no service points to be found. The runway also
doesn't have any navigational aids, however, there is a working beacon present.
